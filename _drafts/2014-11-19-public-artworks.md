Write a blog post comparing the traditional soviet public artwork Monument to the Conquerors of Space with a modern one, e.g. a piece by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer or another one we have looked at in this lecture. Discuss:
•  What is their purpose?
•  Who are they for, and what do they represent?
•  How do they engage the public?
•  How do they relate to their environment?
•  What are they made of - are they permanent or temporary?
•  Are they authorised?
•  If digital: do they visualise data or use virtual or immaterial processes? How do they collect and manifest data?
