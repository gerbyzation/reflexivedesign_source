This week we talked about GPS drawings. This is the practise of walking a figure and keeping a record of your GPS locations so these can be digitally visualised into your 'drawing'. 

One of the characteristics of a GPS drawing is the influence the geoography has on your drawing. Because of (articifial or natural) obstacles forces you to 

GPS drawings are always influenced by the geography of the location where it's drawn. Natural or artificial obstacles make it impossible to draw perfect figures which gives that every drawing has a 'signature' of the location where it was drawn. 

To me the appleal of GPS drawing seems to be in the fact that you can see it as a struggle between you and the location. Humans have always had a tendency to leave a trail and shape their environment to their benefits, but

A little while later we walked the route and you can see the result on the picture below. Because our drawing is on a relative low scale the line is quite wobbly and sometimes we had to divert a bit from our planned route. Also we had a little glitch at the end which added some random lines through the crossing.

If you're interested (and as proof that we did do the walk :) ), you can find the original GPS data here: [GPS data (XML)][coordinates].
