Yesterday Mike gave a presentation for the module DAT201 (Strageties for Art & Technology) about Sound Art, covering several topics and talked about some of the questions. One of the questions was about noise: 'Is noise music?'. That question goes back to the question 'What is noise?'. 

Today's session was a perfect continuation of this topic. We talked about environmental sound with the goal to be more aware of the sounds surrounding you and appriciative of its characteristics. 

> Let’s walk together through a great modern capital, with the ear more attentive than the eye, and we will vary the pleasures of our sensibilities by distinguishing among the gurglings of water, air and gas inside metallic pipes, the rumblings and rattlings of engines breathing with obvious animal spirits, the rising and falling of pistons, the stridency of mechanical saws, the loud jumping of trolleys on their rails, the snapping of whips, the whipping of flags. We will have fun imagining our orchestration of department stores’ sliding doors, the hubbub of the crowds, the different roars of railroad stations, iron foundries, textile mills, printing houses, power plants and subways.

There is a lot of stuff happening around you, but brains are really good at filtering away the 'backgroundnoise' to help you focus. 

We went out and walked around campus with an audiorecorder listening to the sound around us and trying to capture some of those sounds. Quite a lot of sound is too soft or far away to clearly make a record of. But we were able to record some interesting sounds in the workshop, UPSU, outside buildings and from a watertap. 

Then we imported the sounds into Audacity and played around with them. I played around with several effects, among which the 'Paulstretch'. By stretching the audio out, you can get some really nice ambient sounds. I've also done some other things and created a small composition with the different sounds.
