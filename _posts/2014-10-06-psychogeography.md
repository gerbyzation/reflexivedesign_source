In the first practical session of Reflexive Design Mike talked about 'Psychogeography', which is defined as 'the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and the behavior of individuals'. Practically that means making geographical distinction between areas based on emotions.

The emotional judgement of locations is something I recognise doing. Two weeks ago I moved from the Netherlands to Plymouth, so I have loads of stuff to discover here. In the first week you get a lot of impressions and feelings when walking through Plymouth. But in a short period as a week or two things start to feel normal and you pay less attention to your surroundings and how it makes you feel. 

As noted by the worksheet the main practise to do psychogeography is *'derive'*: 'an aimless wandering with senses open to how certain areas make you feel'. We will be using a slightly different approach, We'll draw a circle on the map and plan a route that follows the circle as close as possible.

Because I just moved to Plymouth it was a bit difficult to follow the assignment strictly. So instead of doing an 'imaginary walk', I have done the real walk together with Marcin.
