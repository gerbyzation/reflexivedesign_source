In the first practical session of Reflexive Design Mike talked about 'Psychogeography', which is defined as 'the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and the behavior of individuals'. In understandable English that means making geographical distinction between areas based on emotions.

The emotional judgement of locations is something I recognise doing. I've just moved to Plymouth two weeks ago from the Netherlands, so there is lots of new stuff to discover. In the first week you get a lot of impressions and feelings when walking through Plymouth. But in a short period as a week or two things start to become normal and you pay less attention to your surroundings and how it makes you feel. 

When I was about 10 years old and we'd drive to church on the sundaymorning on our bycicles, we'd come at a crossing with the option to follow the main road or take a right and drive through a block. I always hated it when we'd take the right turn and drive through the neighbourhood. Why? The road through the neighbourhood was a hobbly paved road while the bikelane next to the main road was nice equal asphalt. And even though I had the only bike with springs I hated to drive over that road.

I must admit I didn't follow the instructions strictly, because I've been here for two weeks now makes it a bit difficult to do an 'imaginary walk' through Plymouth. Instead I'll do the real walking :).
