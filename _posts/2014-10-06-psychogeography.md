In the first practical session of Reflexive Design Mike talked about 'Psychogeography', which is defined as 'the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and the behavior of individuals'. Practically that means making geographical distinction between areas based on emotions.

The emotional judgement of locations is something I recognise doing. Two weeks ago I moved from the Netherlands to Plymouth, so I have loads of stuff to discover here. In the first week you get a lot of impressions and feelings when walking through Plymouth. But in a short period as a week or two things start to feel normal and you pay less attention to your surroundings and how it makes you feel. 

As noted by the worksheet the main practise to do psychogeography is *'derive'*: 'an aimless wandering with senses open to how certain areas make you feel'. We will be using a slightly different approach, We'll draw a circle on the map and plan a route that follows the circle as close as possible.

Because I just moved to Plymouth it was a bit difficult to follow the assignment strictly and do an imaginary walk and divede the map up in area's that have different feelings. So we skipped that one and went straight to the real walk!

Marcin and I did the walk according to the route we drew on the map, here you can find some pictures and our findings noted in keypoints:

**Start**

1. Crossing Royal parade & Armada way / House of Fraser
- Open space gives a sense of freedom
- People are busy with their own things (i.e. buying and selling goods)
- gives a sense of capitalism
- building made of massive concrete blocks make you feel small and unwelcome
- feels hurried and bussy

2. Crossing Armada way & Cornwall Str.
- Trees and greenery gives more social area feeling
- even in the middle of the shopping district with loads of people, feels like a different place
- gives rest and more pieace, friendly
- escape from the hurry (rush)
- feels like an oasis

3. Motorway
- in between places
- people don't pay attention, just want to go somewhere
- place of transition (transition of spaces)
- don't want to stay there
- people are not really 'in a place'
