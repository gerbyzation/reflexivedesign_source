Hi!
==

THis is a new version of my personal site, a work in progress!
For now I'll be mainly posting for the DAT203 Reflexive Design module from Digital Art &amp; Technology. Later I'll improve the site and expand it.

Last year I did the course Communcation &amp; Multimedia Design at Avans in Breda, I finished my first year and received my propaedeutics. But I've quit CMD and joined the second year of [Digital Art & Technology] [DAT] at Plymouth University, which I'm really excited about! 

We've started for a few weeks now and I really enjoy it. We're already doing some interesting stuff and there is much more exciting stuff coming :)

Cheers!
